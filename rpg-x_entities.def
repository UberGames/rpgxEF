/*QUAKED item_***** ( 0 0 0 ) (-16 -16 -16) (16 16 16) suspended
DO NOT USE THIS CLASS, IT JUST HOLDS GENERAL INFORMATION.
The suspended flag will allow items to hang in the air, otherwise they are dropped to the next surface.

If an item is the target of another entity, it will not spawn in until fired.

An item fires all of its targets when it is picked up.  If the toucher can't carry it, the targets won't be fired.

"notfree" if set to 1, don't spawn in free for all games
"notteam" if set to 1, don't spawn in team games
"notsingle" if set to 1, don't spawn in single player games
"wait"	override the default wait before respawning.  -1 = never respawn automatically, which can be used with targeted spawning.
"random" random number of plus or minus seconds varied from the respawn time
"count" override quantity or duration on most items.

/*QUAKED misc_model_breakable (1 0 0) (-16 -16 -16) (16 16 16) SOLID AUTOANIMATE DEADSOLID NO_DMODEL INVINCIBLE X X X REPAIRABLE X
-----DESCRIPTION-----
Destroyable *.md3-model. If it dies it will display it's damge model if one exists and fire it's targets.
If repaired by either target_repair (not yet implemented) or hyperspanner (not yet fully implemented) it will fire it's targets

-----SPAWNFLAGS-----
1: SOLID - Movement is blocked by it, if not set, can still be broken by explosions and shots if it has health
2: AUTOANIMATE - Will cycle it's anim
4: DEADSOLID - Stay solid even when destroyed (in case damage model is rather large).
8: NO_DMODEL - Makes it NOT display a damage model when destroyed, even if one exists. Needs to be set if none exist.
16: INVINCIBLE - Can only be broken by being used
32: X - DO NOT USE! This may come in conflict with shared functions from func_breakable.
64: X - DO NOT USE! This may come in conflict with shared functions from func_breakable.
128: X - DO NOT USE! This may come in conflict with shared functions from func_breakable.
256: REPAIRABLE - can be repaired with hyperspanner
512: X - DO NOT USE! This may come in conflict with shared functions from func_breakable.

-----KEYS-----
"model"	- path to the arbitrary .md3 file to display
"health" - how much health to have - default is zero (not breakable)  If you don't set the SOLID flag, but give it health, it can be shot but will not block NPCs or players from moving
"targetname" - when used, dies and displays damagemodel, if any (if not, removes itself)
"target" - What to use when it dies
"paintarget" - target to fire when hit (but not destroyed)
"wait" - how long minimum to wait between firing paintarget each time hit

"luaDie" - Lua-Hook for when the breakable dies

Damage: default is none
"splashDamage" - damage to do (will make it explode on death)
"splashRadius" - radius for above damage

"team" - This cannot take damage from members of this team (2 = blue, 1 = red) 2 will exclude players/clients in RPG-X

"material" - sets the chunk type:
 0 - none (default)
 1 - metal
 2 - glass
 3 - glass and metal
 4 - wood
 5 - stone

-----LUA-----
Finding an MMB for post-spawn manipulation:
For this purpose we have created a function that will return the first of these that has a matching s.origin.
You can get the s.origin ingame as an admin/developer by pointing at the MMB ingame and using the /getorigin-command.
This is how it should look:

vec = vector.Construct(s.origin[X], s.origin[Y], s.origin[Z]);
ent = entity.FindMMB(vec);

Refitting repairablility using lua:
This is a fairly simple addition, here's the code:

vec = vector.Construct(s.origin[X], s.origin[Y], s.origin[Z]);
MMB = entity.FindMMB(vec);
MMB:SetSpawnflags(MMB:GetSpawnflags() + 256);
if MMB:GetHealth() == 0 then --we do require health to be present for repairability
MMB:SetHealth (1);
entity.CallSpawn(ent);

-----LUA-----
Sounds for consoles:
One of the advantages with luaUse-functions is that you can play sounds on the usable you're using this comes in very handy if you'd like to for example play a sound on the turbolift-usable:

	function turbocontrol(ent, other, activator) --set luaUse to turbocontrol for this to trigger
		if ent.GetCount(entity.Find("info_turbolift")) == 1 then --for a trubolift in particular you need an external information provider as lua can't deal with bit-flags. In this case turbolift would be offline.
		    sound.PlaySound(ent, "sound/movers/switches/voyneg.mp3", 0);
		    game.MessagePrint(ent.GetNumber(activator), "=C= Unable to comply: The Turbolift is offline.");
		else
			sound.PlaySound(ent, "sound/voice/computer/tour/trblftmenu.mp3", 0);
		end
	end

Also if you have a (morer or less) generic console that you want to fire generic console sounds off of you can extend this script for any number of sounds of which one will be picked randomly:

	function consolesounds(ent, other, activator)
		i = qmath.irandom(1, <insert number of sounds here>);
		if i == 1 then
			sound.PlaySound(ent, <inseet soundpath here>, 0);
		end
		if i == n then
			sound.PlaySound(ent, <inseet soundpath here>, 0);
		end
	end

-----LUA-----
Retrofitting repairability using lua:
Retrofitting repairability is possible, however it is not easy as we likely have to come by the fact taht we do not have an origin brush.
To start here is the code with no origin brush present: 
			
	ent = entity.FindBModel(bmodel);  
	ent:SetSpawnflags(ent:GetSpawnflags() + 768);  
	--Do not use entity.CallSpawn(ent); after this point for this entity!
	mover.SetAngles2(ent, posX, posY, posZ);
	ent:SetN00bCount(radius);

The bmodel-number can be retrieved ingame as an admin/developer by pointing at the entity and using the /getentinfo command
posX, Y andf Z are the origin (usually the center of brush) of the entity and need too be retrieved manually from within the radiant
radius is a spherical distance around origin/angles2 that the hyperspanner will respond to. It should barely cover the entire facing side of the entity.

In the unlikely event that we do have an origin brush this is the code:
			
	ent = entity.FindBModel(bmodel);  
	ent:SetSpawnflags(ent:GetSpawnflags() + 256);
